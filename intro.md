# Introduction on Current Role:
"Currently, I am working as an Associate Consultant at Yash Technologies, where I focus on Python and Django development, particularly for automation and system management solutions. My role involves gathering client requirements, designing system architectures, and developing robust applications from scratch. I’m also responsible for deploying these applications using Nginx and ensuring seamless operation post-deployment. Additionally, I work on creating Python-based agents for monitoring and automating tasks, integrating them with Django-based servers to provide comprehensive data aggregation and insights."

# Introduction on Current Projects:

# Azure Snapshot
"One of the significant projects I’ve worked on is the Azure VM Snapshots Tool, which allows for seamless management of Azure virtual machines and snapshots. The tool includes features like snapshot creation, scheduling, and management, with interactive visualizations powered by Bokeh.


# Device Management
I contributed to a Device Management System, where I developed a patch management solution that automates patch deployment and compliance reporting. This application manages patches for on-premises devices, cloud-based systems, and end-user laptops, ensuring comprehensive coverage across environments.

The system leverages lightweight Python-based agents installed on devices to collect detailed hardware and software data, which is then centralized for real-time analysis and reporting. To enhance the user experience, I integrated Bokeh for interactive data visualization, enabling IT teams to view compliance trends, patch status, and device metrics in an intuitive and visually engaging manner.

The solution includes advanced features such as patch approval workflows, group-wise patch scheduling, and integration with MSRC (Microsoft Security Response Center) for real-time patch assessment and access to the latest security updates. It integrates with tools like WSUS for patch deployment and supports functionalities like compliance assessment, service backup, LDAP integration to pull devices from different organizational unit (OU) groups, patch reversion, and applications inventory management.


#  VM Commissioning and Decommissioning
Another key project is the VM Commissioning and Decommissioning Automation, where I automated the lifecycle of virtual machines using web interfaces, Power Automate, and Azure Functions to ensure efficiency and scalability in managing virtual resources."

Closing Statement:
"Overall, my current role has honed my expertise in Python, Django, and automation tools, and I am passionate about delivering solutions that streamline operations and improve efficiency for clients."
